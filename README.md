# ðŸ’Š Pillbox

## What is this?

This is a CLI app written in Golang, that can be used to set medications reminders.
I hope you *never* use it, but if you are sick and you are taking meds, this
might help you remember when to take your meds. At least it helped me.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/fteem/pillbox
```

That should do it.
